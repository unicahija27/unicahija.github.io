        Look, it's happened once again
It happens every now and then
Feeling the hurt and hating all the men
Ready to stop it all
That's when I need a friendly face
To see me through these lonely days
Just to put some sunshine in my place
Don't take too long I need you
Here I am
I haven't gone that far away
And since I am
That kind of friend you know
Would stay with you through all the pain
Never to leave you in the rain
Ready to listen to what you've been through
Your woes and blues and share each other's
Points of view
We've been there once before
And kept our points of view
It doesn't really matter if they're never quite the same
We have our rules in different ways
We play the games of different folks with different strokes
And keep our points of viewLook, it's happened once again
